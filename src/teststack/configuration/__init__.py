"""
Combination configuration schema and data models.

* Ideally in the future this holds the configuration schema and the data models are seperated.
For the moment at least this defines the schema and moves away from freeform dictionaries everywhere.
** Configuration needs to support plugins. In a perfect world we'd have a system for plugins to register any extensions
they make to the configuration schema so that we can detect and warn the user when 'invalid' values are set
- nothing is more painful that bloated configurations with cargo-culted values that don't actually do anything -,
until then we have to allow any random configuration key to support plugin configurations.
